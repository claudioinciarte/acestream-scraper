# Documentation Home

Technical documentation for contributors and operators. For setup and everyday use, start with the [wiki home](../wiki/Home.md).

The application has two canonical roots:

- `backend/` is the API/runtime source of truth.
- `frontend/` is the web UI source of truth.

## User guides

- [Illustrated v2 walkthrough](../wiki/Usage.md): sources, checks, TV channels, EPG, playlists and Live TV.
- [Extraction builder guide](../wiki/Extraction-Recipes.md): worked HTML, regex and JSON examples, limits, troubleshooting and saving recipes.
- [Installation and upgrades](../wiki/Installation.md) and [Docker storage/platforms](../wiki/Docker.md).
- [Configuration](../wiki/Configuration.md), [troubleshooting](../wiki/Troubleshooting.md) and [diagnostic bug reports](../wiki/Bug-Reporting.md).
- [Docker command builder](https://pipepito.github.io/acestream-scraper/): generated commands with platform-aware services, checker isolation and storage.

The manual release job mirrors `wiki/` to the GitHub wiki after successful latest promotion. Edit that source directory for durable user-doc changes. Develop validates documentation without publishing it; Pages serves `main/docs`, and Docker Hub text is published manually.

## Key Docs

- `AGENTS.md`: repository-wide Codex instructions, with layered backend, frontend,
  and E2E guidance.
- [Architecture](Architecture.md): current component boundaries, runtime topology,
  data flows, trust boundaries, and extension points.
- [Design system](Design-System.md): semantic tokens, layout, responsive behavior,
  shared UI patterns, accessibility, and contribution rules.
- `docs/architecture/deployment.md`: production and local deployment model for `backend/` + `frontend/`.
- `docs/ops/jenkins-ci.md`: primary Jenkins CI/CD operator guide, cutover steps, and rollback guidance.
- `docs/ops/codex-infrastructure-access.md`: safe Codex access to the local,
  git-ignored Jenkins connection details.
- `docs/ops/reverse-proxy.md`: reverse-proxy/HTTPS deployment — TLS, proxy-level auth, `base_url`, and port-exposure guidance.
- `docs/ops/acestream-arm-engine.md`: operator guide for the in-container AceStream engine on `linux/arm64` / `linux/arm/v7` (what is shipped, runtime settings, known gaps, testing on a Raspberry Pi, pin updates).
- `docs/ops/multiarch-manifest-updates.md`: schema of `docker/manifests/acestream.json` and the procedure for updating engine/platform pins.
- `docs/migration/migration-strategy.md`: cutover rules and migration direction.
- `docs/migration/development-phases.md`: planned phase breakdown.
- `docs/migration/development-progress.md`: current execution progress and completed work.

## Release Docs

- `docs/release/v2-release-notes.md`: user-facing v2 release notes (source for the GitHub release).
- `docs/release/v2-release-readiness.md`: gap audit, closure record, open items before the `v2.0.0` tag, and the two-phase `:latest` publish flow.
- `docs/release/phase5-multiarch-evidence.md`: how multi-arch evidence is produced on Jenkins and the per-release record.

## Testing

- [V2 documentation/browser review, 8 September 2026](testing/v2-launch-doc-review.md): scope, validation and follow-up observations.

- `docs/testing/test-ownership-matrix.md`: canonical test locations and the required-check ownership policy.

## Developer Entry Points

Start with the [development guide](../wiki/Development.md) for local setup and proportionate checks. The [Jenkins scope table](ops/jenkins-ci.md#changes-that-select-ci-work) explains documentation-only validation and publication. Docker Hub text lives in [docs/dockerhub](dockerhub/README.md).

- Backend local run: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --no-proxy-headers`
- Frontend local run: `cd frontend && npm install && npm start`
- Container stack: `docker compose up --build`

## Backend Alembic

Run Alembic from the repo root with the backend virtualenv active:

- `PYTHONPATH=backend alembic -c backend/migrations/alembic.ini history`
- `PYTHONPATH=backend alembic -c backend/migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head`
